# 🚗 Vehicle Speed Estimation

A **computer vision project** that estimates the speed of vehicles from video footage using **OpenCV** and **Python**. The system leverages image processing and object tracking techniques to measure vehicle motion and calculate approximate speed in real time.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🎥 **Video Processing**: Detects and tracks vehicles from video frames.
* 📏 **Speed Calculation**: Estimates vehicle speed using frame difference and calibration.
* ⚡ **Real-Time Processing**: Efficient implementation with Python and OpenCV.
* 🗂️ **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new detection or tracking models.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, CSV (for logging results)
