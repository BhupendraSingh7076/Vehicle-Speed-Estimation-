Real-time vehicle speed detection using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Supervision.

# Vehicle Speed Estimation System

A real-time vehicle speed detection system built with **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Supervision**.  
The project detects and tracks vehicles in video streams, calculates their speed, and provides visual and structured analysis.

## Features
- 🚗 Detect and track vehicles in real-time using YOLOv8.  
- 📏 Calculate vehicle speed from frame displacement and FPS for accurate measurement.  
- 📊 Automated CSV logging of vehicle IDs, speeds, and timestamps.  
- 🎥 Generate annotated output videos for traffic visualization.  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv8  
- OpenCV  
- Supervision  

## Output
- CSV logs with structured vehicle data.  
- Annotated videos showing vehicles and estimated speeds.
